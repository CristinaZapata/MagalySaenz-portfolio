## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I am a Research Assistant at the World Bank. Currently, I work on public finances, researching how reforms regarding withholding instruments and third party reporting impact tax compliance and revenue. I mostly work with firm-level administrative data. 

I am interested in development economics, especially topics related to labor markets, human capital, gender, rural development and public finances.  

I hold a master in Applied Economics from University of Massachusetts Boston and a Bachelor in Economics from Universidad Thomas More in Nicaragua, my home country. 

Previously, I worked at FUNIDES, a Nicaraguan think tank, and at UMB where I worked on labor markets, impact evaluation, education, and social protection.
