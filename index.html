							<h1>Magaly SÃ¡enz</h1>
							<h3>Aspiring Economist</h3> <br />
						</header>
						<p>I am a Research Assistant at the World Bank. Currently, I work on public finances, researching how reforms regarding withholding instruments and third party reporting impact tax compliance and revenue. I mostly work with firm-level administrative data. </p>
						
						<p>I am interested in development economics, especially topics related to labor markets, human capital, gender, rural development and public finances. </p>
						
						<p>I hold a master in Applied Economics from University of Massachusetts Boston and a Bachelor in Economics from Universidad Thomas More in Nicaragua, my home country. </p>
						
						<p>Previously, I worked at FUNIDES, a Nicaraguan think tank, and at UMB where I worked on labor markets, impact evaluation, education, and social protection. </p>
